# Password-generator

## Description

This project showcases a random password generator built using JavaScript. It demonstrates my understanding and application of various JavaScript concepts such as `loops`, `objects`, `arrays`, and `functions`. The generator allows users to create secure passwords based on their chosen criteria, including length, and the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
